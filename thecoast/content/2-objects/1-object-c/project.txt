Text: Inspired by the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical in Either/Or by Søren Kierkegaard, we created a mischievous yet austere lighting series composed of three lamps for nightstands, tables, and floors. In an age where we rely on objects designed to serve our every need without asking for anything in return–Either/Or lamps encourage deliberate and emotionally acute interactions between an individual and their source of light. A user’s touch causes the light’s cradle to rock longingly back and forth, controlling the buoyancy and brightness, to “discover the second face behind the one you see.”
