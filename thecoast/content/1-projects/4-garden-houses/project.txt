Title: Garden & Houses

----

Text: Garden & Houses is a housing project promoting the enjoyment of modern architecture to the public by exploring housing prototypes, sharing economy, and a reconnection to nature within the city. By subverting the suburban ideology of “bedroom communities” that proliferated during the post-World War II era, Garden & Houses joins a roster of regeneration projects in the city of Detroit - which saw a rapid urban decline during the second half of the 20th century but is now experiencing an urban revival.
