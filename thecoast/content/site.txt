Title: The Coast

----

Intro: The Coast is an architecture and design studio that create buildings, environments, and objects. With a profound belief in unexpected connections between forms, functions, materials, and cultures, our projects are characterized by a genuine curiosity, always expansive, never limiting, to explore the in-between. The Coast is currently working on two residences in New York and Hong Kong, a housing project in Detroit and the lighting series Either/Or for Collective Concepts @ICFF.

Before founding The Coast in 2018, he was educated at Parsons School of Design, University of Pennsylvania, and the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University with a Masters in Architecture and a Masters of Science in Development. He co-founded A:LOG- a notebook for architects and has worked at ASH, DillerScofidio+Renfro and Obra Architects.
